# key-rebinder
.NET core application that rebinds keys per process

I came accross an issue when playing an old PC video game (Company of Heroes 2006) that doesn't have the option to remap keyboard keys. So I made this little software myself, hope you'll find it useful.
There is no UI currently so if you wish to remap keys for a video game, find its process name (alt+tab after you launch the game, or any other program for that matter) and put that string in the WindowGameName property in Program.cs in the console application.
